# IFT and Blockchain Transparent Supply Examples
With the success of IBM Food Trust, IBM has made the underlying foundation applicable to all industries (not just food) and released IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply.  IBM Food Trust is now one instantiation of IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply, and as such the API examples have been moved to here: https://github.com/IBM/transparent-supply-examples

Don't worry!  The same APIs that have been used against IBM Food Trust are supported against IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply.
